Small program to perform simple TD simulations

I just started this project, it still lacks the entire physics simulation.
I still do not know how to visualize data, maybe gnuplot (any advice is welcome).

I took the header file needed to read the obj files from here: https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader
