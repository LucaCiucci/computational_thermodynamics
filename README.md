# computational_thermodynamics
Small program to perform simple TD simulations

I just started this project, I do not have much time to dedicate to it and it still lacks most of physics simulation (which I am currently developing).
I still do not know how to visualize data, maybe Qt visualization libraries or gnuplot (any advice is welcome).

I took the header file needed to read the obj files from here: https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader
